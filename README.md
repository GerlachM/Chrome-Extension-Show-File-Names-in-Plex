# Show-File-Names-in-Plex

Go to library and choose the FOLDERS view to see all your folders. Inside the folders, the files are shown with the file names as well! You have to set the X-Plex-Token first in the background.js to make it work, just google it. Add the library as TV Shows as it might not work otherwise. This extension also shows the filenames when you are in the folders view!
