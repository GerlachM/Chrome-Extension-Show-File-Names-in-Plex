# Show-File-Names-in-Plex

[Chrome Extension]

You have to set the X-Plex-Token first in the background.js to make it work, just google it.

Go to library and choose the FOLDERS view to see all your folders. Inside the folders, the files are shown with the file names as well! Add your individual library as "TV Show" as it might not work otherwise. You have to access your plex with http://127.0.0.1:32400/, as it might not work otherwise. This extension ONLY shows the filenames when you are in the folders view!
